Component Based Arch(CBA)

Component
 1. upto react 16 - class based component
       objects creation - memory
 2. react 17 onwards
       Functional components - function

How application works :
index.html
index.js
are the starting points of application

index.js
accesses the `div="root"` from index.html 
using this ReactDOM .createRoot is creating root comp for React
through this root comp,
we can render the child components, e.g. it is  rendering App comp
